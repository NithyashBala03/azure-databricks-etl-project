## üè¢ Business Problem

A multi-regional retail company is facing:
- Fragmented data sources and siloed reporting
- Slow insight generation from Excel-based analysis
- Missed sales opportunities due to poor visibility into product and regional performance
- Inability to scale reporting systems to handle increasing data volumes

---

## üíº Use Case

The company requires a **cloud-native analytics solution** to:
- Automate data ingestion and transformation
- Unify multiple sources into a single trusted layer
- Enable stakeholders to explore and visualize key metrics instantly

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Solved

This project provides a robust pipeline that:
- Ingests and cleans sales and customer data
- Performs real-time data transformations using **PySpark**
- Builds curated, analytics-ready datasets
- Visualizes key KPIs such as revenue trends, sales by product/region, and monthly performance
